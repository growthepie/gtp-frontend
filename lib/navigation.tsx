Although it is not a perfect metric due to the possibility of a single person owning multiple addresses, it can still provide valuable insights into the overall user base of a chain. It is worth noting, however, that this metric can be influenced by Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates a large number of fake identities to artificially inflate the active address count. Therefore, while daily active addresses can be a useful measure, it should be used in conjunction with other metrics to provide a more comprehensive analysis of a chain's user activity.",

However, it should be noted that this metric alone may not provide sufficient insight into the actual value of the transactions being conducted. For instance, while some chains may have a lower transaction count, the value of these transactions may be significantly higher due to their use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. On the other hand, certain chains may have a higher transaction count due to their use in gaming or other applications involving lower value transactions.",

Similarly to how modern storage devices are marketed with specs on read/write speeds rather than the number of files they can process, throughput provides a direct measure of a blockchain's ability to handle compute effectively. Throughput also reveals how close a chain is to its operational limits. This metric is essential for app developers and Layer 2 teams to gauge growth potential, potential cost implications, and performance constraints.",
