          why: "The number of transactions processed on a blockchain is a reliable metric for measuring its usage. However, it should be noted that this metric alone may not provide sufficient insight into the actual value of the transactions being conducted. For instance, while some chains may have a lower transaction count, the value of these transactions may be significantly higher due to their use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. On the other hand, certain chains may have a higher transaction count due to their use in gaming or other applications involving lower value transactions.",

          why: "Daily active addresses is a widely used metric for estimating the number of users on a blockchain network. Although it is not a perfect metric due to the possibility of a single person owning multiple addresses, it can still provide valuable insights into the overall user base of a chain. It is worth noting, however, that this metric can be influenced by Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates a large number of fake identities to artificially inflate the active address count. Therefore, while daily active addresses can be a useful measure, it should be used in conjunction with other metrics to provide a more comprehensive analysis of a chain's user activity.",
