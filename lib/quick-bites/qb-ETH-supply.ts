    "# Major Supply-Impacting Events",
    "The vertical lines in the chart mark the two most recent crucial events that fundamentally changed Ethereum's issuance model:",

    "## The Burn (August 2021)",
    "The implementation of EIP-1559 introduced a mechanism that burns the base fee of every transaction, effectively destroying ETH based on network usage. During periods of high network activity, this burning mechanism can exceed new issuance, making ETH deflationary. This upgrade created a direct link between network usage and ETH supply dynamics.",

    "## The Merge (September 2022)",
    "The transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake marked a dramatic reduction in ETH issuance. Mining rewards (~13,000 ETH/day) were replaced with staking rewards (~1,700 ETH/day), reducing new ETH issuance by about 87%. This change made Ethereum's supply dynamics mathematically predictable with minimal and precisely controlled issuance. Additionally, The Merge reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by approximately 99.95%, as energy-intensive mining was replaced with environmentally friendly staking.",
