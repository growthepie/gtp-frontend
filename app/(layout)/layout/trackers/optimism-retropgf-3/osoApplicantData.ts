At that time, OpenEtherem had a share of 15% of all Ethereum mainnet nodes. \nOne of my main contributions was EIP1559 implementation (fee mechanism) for OpenEtherem.\nExcept that, I was part of regular ETH DEV calls and main responsible for testing the client and communicating with other client team developers.\nOther than that, I also contributed to rust-web3 library.\nOther than that, I am one of the main developers of Cowswap backend project (https://github.com/cowprotocol/services), a decentralized exchange aiming to tackle the MEV problem and improve prices for end users by batching ofchain intent trades.",

      "Impact Description": "At the time of my contributions to OpenEthereum, this client had ~15% of all ethereum mainnet nodes share, the second biggest share, right after Geth. Unfortenately, the project was shut down after some time, due to lack of funding.\nOpenEthereum London hard fork discovered a critical bug in Geth client on one of the test networks just before the mainnet activation. Obviously, this prevented a serious consensus bug between geth client and the rest of the clients. London hard fork also contained the EIP1559 implementation - change in the fee mechanism for Ethereum.\nI also had contributions to rust web3 library widely used for all rust projects on ethereum and EVM compatible chains and also contributed to Cowswap project which main impact is protecting users from MEV and giving best prices.",

      "Impact Description": "The OP Collective can rely on us growing the OP user, developer and investor base through our data and blockspace analysis, providing transparency around chain traction, liquidity & chain usage. Comparing metrics allows making informed decision about which chain & dApp to use and build on by providing developer content. On top of our accessible data visualization, educational knowledge around Layer 2s in the form of Wikis, articles, threads and regular posts make the space more transparent and different OP chains become more familiar. You can compare labeled smart contracts & download via API.\n\nOur data/blockspace visualizations were used in podcasts like The Daily Gwei, Bankless & charts are constantly posted on socials like X and Farcaster to help understand the OP ecosystem.",

These surveys enable users to ask important questions of the community, build their personal reputation by answering, and earn rewards while they\u2019re at it.\n\nWe\u2019ve deployed over 95 surveys in 8 months, and have nearly 500 monthly active users.",

      "Contribution Description": "Sourcify provides an open-source alternative to existing proprietary source code verification tools for contracts\n\nAnyone can run their own Sourcify to trustlessly verify contracts. It's also a knowledge-gathering point for verification, whereas with close source tools, the learnings in verification and the exceptions that need to be handled are not shared with the community.\n\nThe data is open. You don't need to scrape to bulk download contracts. The contract repository is published to IPFS and S3 buckets regularly. \n\nSourcify also aims to foster the \"full matches\" with contract metadata hashes. This ensures cryptographic guarantees for the exactness of the contract. It's nicely demonstrated at playground.sourcify.dev.",

We also \"monitor\" those networks to catch contract creations and verify automatically if the source code is published on IPFS.",

      "Contribution Description": "Fast, free, and built for web3 contributors, Taxman is a quick and easy tool to calculate DAO income taxes.\n\nTaxman was built in BanklessDAO, a landing place for new web3 contributors.  One of the biggest surprises facing new contributors is the tax liability they take on when accepting tokens for their work. The 2021 tax season was especially bad, as token prices fell by 80-90%, leaving contributors with a hefty, surprise tax bill and reduced ability to pay.  Many contributors walked away from the space entirely.\n\nTo solve this, Taxman allows anyone to calculate their DAO income taxes in their own fiat currency in 10 minutes.  DAO contributors can set aside taxes as they earn, avoiding a surprise tax bill, giving them piece of mind to continue contributing to they web3 projects they love.",

      "Contribution Description": "Adding IPFS support in CURL took 506 days (see contribution PR link) which landed in the 8.4.0 release. Available as of Oct 11th 2024.\n\nThis contribution is two-fold.\n\n1. It allows a user to set an IPFS gateway to use for IPFS URLs (ipfs:// and ipns://). If a local node is installed and running, curl will try and find it's configured gateway without any additional user configuration.\n\n2. It translates IPFS URLs internally to the defined (or detected) gateway thus giving the user a smooth IPFS usage experience without them ever seeing the gateway part of a URL.\n\nThese additions to CURL make it accept the IPFS URLs without the need to prefix them with a gateway (a central point of entry).",

Ideally you want the user to specify just the IPFS parts, the gateway needs to be a configuration. The changes made in curl 8.4.0 do exactly that. Users can now use an IPFS URL like this:\ncurl ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\n\nThe gateway is effectively reduced to a configuration detail. Users of curl now don't need to share the gateway anymore and can instead use plain simple IPFS URLs.\n\nCURL is estimated to be installed at ~20 billion places making this a potential huge impact for IPFS adoption and another step in a more distributed world.",

The team added support for the first non EVM-equivalent version of the OVM in 2020, and has since worked on ways to mitigate issues faced by users unaware of the differences between EVM versions on Optimism and Mainnet.\n\nVyper's design principles prioritize security and audibility.

The service has been well loved on Ethereum mainnet (over 25k users, 300k transactions a month, over 150M assets under monitoring), and we are so excited to bring Webacy safety tools to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWallet Watch allows users to monitor all of their wallets and accounts, receiving real time SMS and email notifications whenever ANYTHING interacts with their wallet. This means inbound and outbound transactions, airdrops, royalty payments, and even things like spam drops, drains, and other potentially malicious transactions. We believe knowledge is power. We're so excited to bring these self-custody safety tools to Optimism, making the chain safer for users!",

We found great success on Ethereum mainnet, and were excited to bring our services to the amazing communities and projects on Optimism. After a lot of hard work, its' finally live, and we're so pumped to bring these safety tools to the ecosystem! Now any user on Optimism can monitor interactions, transactions, and assets on-chain, for as many wallets as they'd like! This not only brings more transparency to the space, but it also helps with the entire user experience, trust, and interaction across the communities.",

      "Contribution Description": "This submission is for a) Optimism\u2019s official bi-weekly community calls and b) other organized community events including mission pitch sessions, discord discussions, and badgeholder speed networking events. The community calls have provided a central place for updates, discussion, decision-making, and onboarding of new governance members. The additional events have filled communication needs for the community as they have surfaced. The mission pitch session allowed for a rapid display of mission proposals. The badgeholder speed networking provided a necessary medium for badgeholders to network and grow community around their shared commitment to the OP Collective.",

      "Impact Description": "These calls have become a pillar of Optimism Governance infrastructure, and have had an outsized impact as the main place where governance decisions are made and important updates and announcements are shared. Many impactful decisions were facilitated by these calls; for example a large number of improvements to missions being implemented in Season 5 stemmed directly from community feedback on call #23. In addition, these calls have helped transition many delegates from new to active-and-contributing by being the go-to place for onboarding. The pitch session for mission proposals aided delegates in making better voting decisions for the batch of missions. The speed-networking for badgeholders fostered connection amongst a diverse group of individuals centered around Optimism.",

Our OP-stack is built for treasure-hunt battles where players win or lose on-chain items. We also supply in-game $OP airdrops for players who retrieve certain game items.\n\n3. Another World showcases a simplified UX for both web3 and web2 players to enter a 3D world. Web3 players opt-in by typing in ENS at the entry menu while web2 users are free to play using an URL. \n\n4. Our progress and game sample codes are open-source on GitHub.",

      "Contribution Description": "We have developed a way of practically using ZK Proof technology to execute game logic in client code that is verifiable on-chain. The technique uses Circom SNARK circuits with players' transaction call data used as signal inputs. \n\nThis minimises EVM execution and storage during mutliplayer game sessions and allows players to cheaply claim onchain rewards with proof of the session results generated in their game client.\n",

      "Impact Description": "The kind of games that are viable for writing entirely on chain is constrained by technical limitations and transaction costs. By increasing the complexity of game logic that can be run per transaction, we are opening up the design space available to fully onchain games.\n\nFully onchain games are a growing branch of decentralised applications and a potentially massive use case for the Optimism echo system. Furthermore, as Autonomous Worlds they are a test bed for the technical and governance structures required for a future of ownerless, composable applications.\n\nPlaymint's work on Client Side Proofs was released as a public good and shared with other teams in the space. Since the time of its release the idea of running proofs on clients has been considered a practical possibility.",

While the Collective envisions a world where public goods equate to profitability, Jessy's house actualizes this by nurturing open-source projects.

The house's emphasis on free open-source software resonates with the Collective's retroactive public goods funding, underscoring the belief that true value lies in communal benefits. We challenge traditional notions of profit, advocating for a model where community-driven initiatives and shared benefits define success in the Ethereum landscape.",

We've substantially aided partner protocols: 350k deposited on Clipper\u2019s LP, 13k accounts for Tally, etc. \nAs OP Army\u2019s goal was to identify experienced web3 users, we\u2019ve discerned ~10k skilled users from 59k participants post rigorous Sybil checks through our collabs with core DeFi and NFT protocols. Our novel AEE (Attestation Exclusive Events) rewards these 10k with added benefits to incentivize more value creation.

      "Contribution Description": "Block explorers provide vital infrastructure, transparency, and data availability to all blockchain users. Blockscout brings an open-source ethos and community-driven development to the Optimism explorer ecosystem. Over the past 6 months Blockscout has continued to improve and optimize the Optimism explorer for OP mainnet and testnet (Goerli & Sepolia) instances. \n\nIn June 2023 we updated to the latest 5.2.0 version and deployed a new UI, which includes several new L2 relevant views, account features for users, and an app marketplace for projects on Optimism. In September we introduced the OP Sepolia instance, currently the only fully-functional explorer instance available for the OP Sepolia chain. Blockscout APIs (both RPC and REST API) are available for Optimism developers and projects.",

Developers use Blockscout's APIs to incorporate chain data into their applications, deploy and debug on testnets, or verify contracts on-chain through the front-end interface. Projects use Blockscout to highlight their apps on the app marketplace and monitor and check interactions with their contracts. Everyone can use the explorer to check & confirm details of their transactions and holdings, create private and public tags, and inspect anything that happens on the Optimism network.  \n\nBlockscout is open source and can be modified and customized for the Optimism Collective. We have worked with the collective to create new views, quickly spin up testnets, and develop new features requested by users. ",

But unlike a regular online content house, as an onchain collective we have been able to leverage the OP stack in our core infrastructure so that we're not only talking the talk, but walking the walk! Not only have we produced high quality videos, panels & podcasts about Optimism, Zora & BASE, but we have also taken steps to involve our community in actually using these networks to mint our content and our community NFT collections.

This contributes directly to network decentralization.\n\nAdditionally, our work empowers developers by providing them with the tools necessary to run a development or testing node. This includes running a L1 node on a similar device so L2 nodes can connect to it.\n\nLastly, we focused on enabling support for the Superchain (via Optimism+Base) to contribute to the multi-chain idea of scaling Ethereum.",

For example Robo labs was one of the projects we referred to apply for OP grants.\n\nThe voluntary nature of the project and no fee involved means we can only dedicate limited resources to our efforts. Hence we never properly documented the number of projects that have secured grants directly or indirectly through help from Web3 Native.\n\nOur accelerator and VC lists provide projects with additional options to get support when grants might not be the best route to get funding.",

There were several competing teams in early 2023 vying to launch a Quix replacement - a badly needed solution, but only 2 teams actually ever did launch (NFTEarth and Zonic).

Over 16 months, we onboarded +150 Latin Americans into Optimistic Collective discussions, addressing language barriers and information asymmetry. We developed an internal meta-governance through an experimental process.\n\nOur contribution is our work in the forum and the documentation of this pilot project. The backbone consists of 15 community governance calls with 514 attendees who voted on 233 financial, organizational, and operational decisions.\n\nBeyond this, we promoted governance topics at online and IRL events, notably #GovernanceDay organized by SEED Latam (Buenos Aires, 2023), attracting 200 attendees with 3 talks on Public Goods and Optimism Governance.",

We are committed to actively developing mechanisms to combat apathy and facilitate the democratization of information and decision-making within the Optimistic Collective.",

      "Contribution Description": "RegenScore is an experiment created to support a more inclusive OP Citizen House. It can be used for the qualification of ecosystem members through a transparent, fair, and data-driven approach. Thus providing better governance access for public goods funding to verified regen actors across the wider web3 ecosystem. \n\nCurrent contributions include:\n\n- Analytical model for behaviour scoring described in documentation and supported by statistical sampling\n- A website for checking out your score and minting the on-chain attestation (including a schema, with separate scoring just for OP behaviours) (open source)\n- A series of communications with the OP and web3 community for feedback and engagement over various channels",

Holonym's mission is to build open source tools for decentralized identity and secure key custody. Our focus is on digital rights, user-centric privacy controls, and transparent governance to accelerate open civics and decentralized science (DeSci). The OP ecosystem is our chosen infra to accomplish this mission.\n\nAlmost 18,000 users have added themselves to the Holonym identity mixer on the OP blockchain. Of these, over ~9000 have minted ZK SBTs proving that they are a real unique person, and not a bot. As part of this work, we've deployed smart contracts such as ZK SBT proof smart contracts, a large anonymity set, example issuers in rust, a DeSci identity registry, and privacy relayer contract.",

Borrowers can receive a fixed-duration loan of fungible tokens backed by fungible or non-fungible tokens, while lenders can earn interest by granting these loans. The protocol is trustless, and immutable.\n\nWe are strong believers that the OP stack is a main pillar of Ethereum scaling. For this reason our platform provides an opportunity on the OP stack for borrowers to get peer to peer fixed terms loans and lenders to get rewarded for lending against ERC-20s, and NFTs (and soon RWAs).\n",

Since the initial deployment of Teleport in November 2022, Maker governance has voted to change its multi-chain roadmap due to the \u201cEndgame\u201d which resulted in pausing further growth of Teleport, however it did provide an early technical improvement for Optimism users and was a pioneer in native asset burning/minting on chain.",

This kind of content, is slightly more geared towards a technical audience including builders and devs. The goal is to empower them to build out customized & optimized execution layers on top of Ethereum's battle-tested security guarantees that are more performant and secure.\n",

      "Contribution Description": "I am driven by the commitment to bridge the knowledge gap in the blockchain ecosystem, specifically in the realm of blockchain engineering. Despite the increasing interest in this field, there is a noticeable scarcity of comprehensive educational resources that span from foundational knowledge to intricate concepts. To that end, I've envisioned a project dedicated to delivering blockchain engineering knowledge, making it accessible to anyone keen on diving into this domain.\n\nMy contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem and the Optimism Collective are already evident through my writings and educational repositories, notably the 'Yul by Example' GitHub repo. This repository serves as an educational guide and has already garnered appreciation from many: Yul by Example.",

      "Contribution Description": "Over the past years i have created numerous Dune Dashboards (which are listed below) regarding the Optimism Ecosystem, including a chain overview (transactions, TVL, projects), governance statistics (delegates data), after bridge overview (what do users do after bridgeging), data about the $OP token (holders, price, airdrops), but also study's on Airdrop effect and Coinbase Quests. I also covered serveral projects that currently have prescence on OP like Velodrome and Polynomial. These dashboards have been referenced on serveral places.\n\nBesides creating new dashboards, existing ones continuously need updates. Reasons are for example: 1) Adding new metrics to dashboards, 2) Contracts/dapps get updated, 3) Dune has migrated to a new query language therefore all querys needed rewriting. \n\n",

This economic model is a significant milestone towards \"Impact = Profit\".\n\nIn 2023 we deployed Aragon OS & our CommonsDAO tools to Optimism, enabling truly decentralized DAOs on Optimism. Tao Voting features Delegation and \"Wait for Quiet\" to prevent last-minute vote manipulation.

Optimism is now the only network where this no-code solution can be used. \n\nMore indirectly, our open source research on Augmented Bonding Curves and Conviction Voting has been a public good for the Ethereum and web3 community. The ABC was charging mint and burn fees years before friend.tech launched with a similar mechanism. ",

      "Contribution Description": "I built an image-focused client for Farcaster, which recently migrated to OP Mainnet. Given that most of the existing Farcaster clients focus on \"words\", I wanted to provide a way for users to showcase all of their visual content on the Farcaster network. Users can view feeds of images sorted by Farcaster channels (which are like decentralized subreddits organized around an NFT) and by different users, including the ones they've liked. Although it's a relatively simple application, I've received great feedback from the community so far.",

For instance, users can choose Apple Pay to purchase signers when they connect their accounts to other clients built on top of Farcaster. This extends to other onchain actions such as signing up for an account, recovering an account, and paying for storage. As many teams build consumer experiences on top of the Superchain ecosystem, this type of UX will be essential in onboarding the next wave of users who are new to the space and aren't as crypto-savvy.",

We demonstrate that optimism can verify secp256r1 signatures for a cheap amount of gas. Which ultimately demonstrates that every recent hardware can use built in secure enclave as smart wallet.",

The wallet remains completely invisible to the user. This is a quite recent innovation so the impact is limited. However we showcased in front of a large crowd. We then received a lot of questions on 4337 related groups (4337 mafia), we are now helping different team to leverage this.\n\nDoing this project we also discovered two critical vulnerabilities in passkey implementations that were used. We did a responsible disclosure free of charges, we thus have protected users from potential loss.",

      "Contribution Description": "In October 2022, Decent became one of the first NFT creator platforms to deploy NFTs to Optimism. Our DCNT721a NFT contract is the most used contract on Optimism. In the last year we've had over 22M NFTs minted on OP like drops with partners including Optimism, World Coin, Conduit, Base, and more. We didn't have any fee collection on for almost all of these mints. \n\nWe also built a product called The Box that enables 1-click transactions from any token on any chain - meaning that users can make transactions on Optimism (or other L2s) without needing native tokens on Optimism and we do all the bridging and swapping in the background at the Point of Sale (or Point of Transaction). This has already brought a few thousand transactions to Optimism and been integrated to enable payment for NFTs",

Launching our credibly-neutral relay that month, we now connect to ~75% of validators, all major builders, and relay around ~30% of Ethereum blocks, reducing block censorship to 29%. This relay fortifies proposer-builder separation, leveling the playing field for all proposers in accessing MEV revenue, thereby bolstering decentralization. Running an effective relay is costly (10k - 20k a month) with thousands of block bids submitted each slot, and has so far been funded entirely by generous supporters.\n",

It has 48 episodes so far, incl. interviews with founders of ZORA, WalletConnect, Farcaster, Zapper, Gnosis & many more.\n\n2. Goldmine3: Listeners asked me for a way to browse through stories & tactics shared on the podcast, so I built a searchable repo of real web3 case studies.\n\n3. Product communications guide: As I've spoken with 100+ crypto founders, I found they find it hard to explain what their products do. So I wrote a guide with 40 examples of good & bad practices.\n\n4.

So I open-sourced it.\n\nSince the podcast is focused on niche, tactical know-how, it only had a bit more than 1,500 subscribers. My guide also had a bit more than 1,000 readers. But most of these people were crypto devs & founders, and some of them shared their praise.",

It connects to an Ethereum source, parses blocks, transactions, and logs and maps data onto PG tables. A single E2PG can index events across many L2s into a single Postgres database. E2PG connects to Ethereum by 1 of 3 ways: JSON RPC API, full node file system (fast), or using RLPS (slower than full node but faster than JSON RPC).\n\nRLPS is an HTTP API that delivers compressed RLP data for: blocks, transactions, and logs designed specifically for indexers. Index Supply hosted RLPS runs on many chains including the following OP L2s: 10, 420, 8453, and 84531. Index Supply operates a full nodes (op-geth, op-node) for each hosted RLPS API.",

Since then we've made it dead simple to boot up an E2PG indexer and have it be connected to Optimism and Base to start indexing data across those chains. To my knowledge, E2PG + RLPS is the quickest way to get data from multiple L2 chains into a Postgres database. I don't believe any of the hosted API providers are as easy to setup or are as fast as RLPS to index historical data.",

      "Contribution Description": "Over the summer of 2023, a group of 33 researchers participated in the inaugural Summer of Protocols program. They were tasked with exploring protocols, broadly construed, from various angles and across a range of different domains. By going broad, the researchers were able to find insights that applied in many contexts, including blockchain protocols such as Optimism and Ethereum. \n\nSome themes explored include the evolution of safety protocols, what \"protocol death\" looks like, the interplay of human agency and formulaic protocols, and more. \n\nThe output of the program is being published for all to access. The hope is for the program to help the Ethereum and Optimism communities become more \"protocol literate\" and have a better theoretical understanding of how protocols work. ",

SoP aims to give the OP Collective the tools to get better at the latter. \n\nSoP is also a way for the Ethereum community to engage with experts outside of blockchain that want to also better understand protocols for their domain of interest, and build bridges with communities we may otherwise not be able to.

Hailing from a Portuguese linguistic background and being a participant in its speaking communities, I continuously strive to shed light on the ethos values of Optimism. My belief in a potentially improved world that can be constructed with this technology propels me. This endeavor transcends into a more social and cultural task, uplifted by the culture of public goods, open source, superchain, and beyond. My outreach spans across texts written in Portuguese and English, newsletters and various other media channels, all echoing this vision.\n\n1. Overview of analytics data link",

OPP was the first meme token listed on Velodrome and the project was baked by a good veVELO position accumulated thanks to its community.\nI've took the lead of the project so it can survive, with the goal of contributing to the whole Optimism ecosystem as a community project.\n\nIn that context, I've started working on the Autobribes protocol. It's goal is to act as liquidity incentivization layer that supports Velodrome by locking tokens instead of dumping. Users stake their LP on Autobribes and are rewarded with \"real yield\", while Autobribes farm and lock VELO. The real yield is obtained from bribe chasing. Two instances have been deployed on Optimism: the \"Reliquary Prime\", and \"Autobribes for Velodrome\".",

This is a staking smart contract that rewards long term participants.\nBy integrating the Reliquary with Velodrome, I've contributed to bring a new DeFi primitive that can be used as a layer on top of any ve(3,3) DEX.",

We carried our blog from web2 to web3 by selecting Mirror and allowing our community to mint articles on optimism.\n\nWe organised a physical onboarding workshop creating new wallets and doing hands on onboarding with token transfers and NFT minting. Collaborated with Otterspace.xyz for souldbound NFTs on Optimism.\n\nWe also collaborated with Greenpill Turkey and shared our know how about grants and fundraising. With their connections to legal NGOs, we opened an account for Greenpill on giveth.io and onboarded 4 NGOs for fundraising using Safe{Wallet} on Optimism.\n\nSince there is quite a bit of articles and tweets, we made a spreadsheet with the list in the first link.\n\n\n\n",

It has a very low footprint, which allows it to run in consumer hardware, not requiring much more resources than a regular archive node.\n\nIt has a decoupled architecture, which means it is composed by an UI and an API which can be used separately. That enabled an increasing ecosystem to flourish:\n\n- Hosted APIs by Llamanodes and Quicknode\n- Community-develop Dappnode packages\n- Otterscan API implemented in Anvil, allowing Otterscan UI to be used in local development.\n- OP-Otterscan fork developed by Test-in-Prod team.\n\nThe last one enabled the OP collective to use Otterscan since the bedrock upgrade, and now Optimism can benefit from all innovations we are building in Otterscan.",

But it is hard to justify diversity to end users when they see no clear benefit from it.\n\nOtterscan, through OP-Otterscan/OP-Erigon brings a strong motivation for a different client to be used, along with a killer dapp that can be used with it. So, supporting Otterscan means creating more incentives to justify the entire OP-Stack architecture.\n\nDeveloper ecosystem: explorers are a fundamental piece of software for developers to understand what's happening onchain. The market leader is a closed source product; we are opensource and able to be run on developers' machines. We also promote open datasets, like Sourcify for contract verification.\n\nSupporting Otterscan means less reliance on vendor lock-in and closed databases.",

These contributions explain Optimism's rollup technology, staking, governance, DeFi integrations, and benefits. My explainers aim to make Optimism more accessible for developers and users. I also created posts and videos to raise awareness of Optimism updates, statistics, partners, and details around the airdrop. While I have not directly contributed code or capital, I believe my content broadens Optimism's reach through education. Making information on Optimism easy to digest serves to further its adoption and progress as a key Ethereum scaling solution.",

There are over 900 unique holders of our membership NFT. Many of which were new to Optimism and had to bridge funds to mint/buy the NFT on Optimism.\n\nThere's a healthy mix of some of the best founders in DeFi in our community as well as \"retail users\" from emerging markets. One of our main missions at Cryptotesters is to bridge the gap between users and founders. We airdropped half of these membership NFTs to old community members before the mint date 2 years ago and have given many away since in order to give people from all backgrounds a chance of entering.\n",

I believe that to date, no one has written a more detailed and informative piece of content about the OP Stack than I have and my piece was well received even without ever making it into any of Optimism's feeds (which would have amplified it substantially).

      "Contribution Description": "Since Optimism launched I've onboarded a lot of people to Optimism, but didn't ever think about officially onboarding people and supporting Optimism and getting RetroPGF funds for it.\n\nMy efforts to onboard people started in 2021 via a small project called Mafia Creativa - a creative outreach and collective based on:\n-free education and onboarding into web3\n-leveraging creativity for the common good\n\nWe hosted numerous calls, twitter spaces and virtual events for crypto curious romanians. Back them public goods in web3 were synonimous with Gitcoin and Optimism so most of our calls were focused around that.\n\nIn early 2023 I created RoOptimism a twitter account that's 100% focused on onboarding and educating romanians around Optimism.",

In the future, when Op Stack networks explode, we believe that not only native Op Stack bridges, but also optimistic bridges will be indispensable. This is because optimistic bridges are currently the cheapest and fastest of all bridge types. We will continue to contribute to the Optimism ecosystem by actively bridging the Op Stack ecosystem.",

Many emerging OP-stack chains aren't supported, requiring analytics to run a full node to access the data they need to power analytics on their app or at the chain/multi-chain level.\n\nSolution: indexed.xyz\u00a0is a public, open, and CC0-licensed dataset that allows anyone to freely download, copy, and analyze chain data (incl. OP-stack chains like Zora and Base) without any restriction. By adopting a local-first approach, we enable builders to leverage their local storage and compute resources, making it easier and more affordable to work with crypto data, all while providing more flexibility and control.",

Our flagship products are our production-capable beacon chain and validator client. In addition, we maintain public repositories of useful tools for public use. Some of these libraries include BLS, SSZ, Discv5, Gossipsub, and Noise. \n\nActive work is being completed to support the OP Stack by enabling EIP-4844 blobs to benefit L2s like Optimism, reducing tx costs of L2 fees and increasing client diversity at the L1 protocol level. Additionally, some Lodestar team members have contributed to side projects such as Zipline Casper and to initiatives such as the Optimism Collective.\n\nWe fully support other teams in Protocol and projects which indirectly fund client team implementors such as Protocol Guild.",

ABIs can also be synced in order to generate an UI to interact with the contract.\n2. Teams\nThrough either the UI or the API, teams can connect their hosted testnet RPC and get a full explorer accessible through a public url (can be their own domain), making easier to do internal/user testing.\n3. Appchains\nIt can be block explorer for Optimism L2s. It takes a few seconds to launch and everything is handled automatically.\nIt has an API to launch explorers on demand (especially important considering all the \"L2 as a service\" launching).",

Despite its widespread use, TypeChain has recently been deprecated in favor of newer alternatives. This makes it perfect candidate for RPGF.\n\nDethCode offers the ability to browse smart contracts within ephemeral instances of VS Code. It supports both OP and Base networks. The innovative concept behind DC impressed Etherscan so much that they integrated similar functionality directly into their product.

If too much of the Ethereum network is controlled by a small amount of people this damages Ethereum's credible neutrality and it could no longer serve effectively as the base layer for projects like Optimism.",

And with ~80% of our builders being new to crypto or more junior developers, we believe that TurboETH is not only increasing the number of active builders in the Optimism Collective, but also helping to retain developers in their transition from launching contracts to building applications.",

      "Impact Description": "IPFS is a system for moving data across decentralized networks, with >11M weekly users and 250K public p2p nodes. Highlights:\n\n1. Off-chain storage. IPFS provides verifiable, off-chain storage, often used to reduce on-chain needs in Ethereum & Optimism. Examples: TrueBlocks (local IPFS-based index for EVM chains, built with grants from OP & EF), Snapshot (IPFS-based off-chain voting).\n\n2. Go-to distribution network for fully decentralized third-party app frontends (for gaming, DeFi, & more). We run gateway services that serve 900M requests/wk, and added native IPFS support to browsers like Chromium & Brave.\n\n3. NFT metadata gold standard. Over 115M NFTs are stored on IPFS, including leading platforms OpenSea (which supports Optimism NFTs), Rarible, and Zora.\n",

Delegate Dashboard - We have indexed 1.5k delegates and their activity on forum and off/on chain voting system and is being updated daily. It's used to hold delegates accountable, improve visibility and help tokenholders discover candidates.\n\n2. Onchain DAO Delegate Registry - Delegate info is scattered across different gov. frontends. To solve this, we built an onchain registry of delegates on Optimism to store all delegate info. \n\n3. Karma GAP (Grantee Accountability Protocol) - It's difficult for community to keep track of grantees and their progress. We built protocol on Optimism+EAS to help grantees post updates, hold them accountable and build rep. ",

DAO Delegate Registry: Karma has already integrated the Delegate Registry into all our dashboards for various DAOs. Delegates across different DAOs are starting to register their information onchain.\n\n3. Karma GAP - We soft launched GAP and grantees are starting to post milestone updates onchain.",

      "Contribution Description": "Season 4 has been an inflection point for the grants program, during which the review process went from a system that worked in theory to a system that is strengthened by practice.\n\nOn average, the Cycles in Season 4 saw a nearly 30% increase in proposals relative to Season 3 Cycles. There were more than 350 total proposals processed by the Grants Council in Season 4, relative to approximately 150 proposals processed in Season 3.\n\nThe Council scaled its process to accommodate the growing demand for Optimism grants. Each sub-committee refined rubrics tailored to the goal of Intent 2 (Innovating on Novel Applications), and the reviewers learned how to provide robust, yet efficient reviews to manage substantial growth.  We also piloted demand-based granting through the RFG program.",

The council was able to generate meaningful requests for grants that ranged from audit services and RPC capacity to cross chain interoperability research.  Overall, the grants council has reduced the workload of Token House delegates, enabling them to focus their energies on high-impact votes.\n",

The smart contract responsible for this interaction is deployed to the Base/Optimism to achieve low costs and speed that contribute to superior ease of use and accessibility of the product.\n\nTokepad simplifies token creation through a beautiful user interface and democratizes the process for everyone.

It also uses several core infrastructure components (client implementations, specifications, test suites, etc.) developed and maintained by Protocol Guild contributors over the years. Optimism also directly benefits from protocol upgrades such as proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), which will reduce the fees its users need to pay.\n\nAll of this work supports a mutual relationship;\n- Ethereum provides an infrastructural foundation with particular characteristics (eg social, political, technical, economic) that only it can provide\n- Optimism produces lower-cost blockspace, while still inheriting some of Ethereum's characteristics, but at the same time allowing for more experimentation",

It is a shining star of sustainable DeFi on Optimism.\n\nClipper\u2019s pricing beats 0x API >90% of the time on at least one leg (see price study). It uses 15% less gas than Uniswap and has a customized Optimism-native deployment that further reduces gas use by optimizing call data sent to Ethereum. For LPs, Clipper has delivered above market returns compared to both HODLing and a perfectly rebalancing pool of assets. Unlike most DEXs, it has no impermanent loss and only executes trades that are profitable for LPs. \n\nClipper has also run a series of community campaigns called Adventures, which drove thousands of new active users to Optimism.",

Supporting Ethereum from early years to PoS migration, optimistic rollups are no stranger to the values that have helped the Ethereum ecosystem, and Dappnode has recently added Optimism to its Rollups menu, a dashboard that lets you easily run a node.

      "Contribution Description": "We've developed a tool that has enabled NFT communities on Optimism and Base to acquire ENS sub-domains at zero cost. This significant accomplishment was made possible through the implementation of ENS wildcard resolution. Our application has already empowered ENS name holders to seamlessly connect their names/domains with the contract addresses of NFT collections, resulting in the automatic provision of free subdomains linked to individual token IDs.\n\nAs a real-world example, consider the OptiChads collection. Every Chad owner automatically received an ENS subdomain under optichads.eth, precisely corresponding to the token ID of their NFT. For instance, the subdomain 69.optichads.eth, directly resolves to the address of the individual who owns Chad #69. ",

Flexible Voting is developed and maintained by ScopeLift.\n\nFor a DAO that adopts it, the Flexible Voting extension allows delegates to split their voting weight across For/Against/Abstain options for a given proposal. This new building block allows arbitrary delegate contracts to be developed which can unlock all kinds of new use cases. Of particular relevance to Optimism is the ability to vote with tokens bridged to L2, a use case ScopeLift is currently building.\n\nIt also enables other use cases like Voting with tokens while earning yield in DeFi, shielded voting (i.e. secret/private voting), liquid delegation and more.",

Notably, Gitcoin runs Grants Rounds on Optimism, and has just launched their own OP Stack network (PGN), and PoolTogether just launched version 5 of their protocol on Optimism first.\n\nScopeLift is actively building a solution to cross chain voting, i.e. enable token holders for these DAOs (and future adopters of Flexible Voting), to bridge their tokens off mainnet and vote with them. The first network we are targeting for this product is Optimism. Within the next few months, we expect to go live, allowing token holders for these DAOs to bridge and vote from Optimism. ",

      "Contribution Description": "Our contributions to Optimism are multifaceted, anchored at the Giveth House in Barcelona. This isn't just a space; it's a living emblem of collaboration, hosting an array of Web3 initiatives such as Giveth, ETHFoundation, ENS, Celo, L2Beat, Gitcoin, DAppNode, Vocdoni, Aragon, dOrg, 1Hive, MakerDAO and so many more. The Giveth House proudly amplifies RetroPGF's presence. Our space doesn't just host a sign; it immerses every visitor in RetroPGF's narrative through visible logos and available merchandise, forging a connection with our ecosystem. People come in and inquire about RetroPGF, sparking lively debates and meaningful discussions.\nWe proudly hosted the crew representing RetroPGF at ETHBCN, showcasing our commitment to nurturing public goods.",

And this is just one story of many more about people who came and had the space to hack on public goods and didn\u2019t have to worry about paying rent. \nJordi Baylina who\u2019s been a close partner and co-founder of Giveth has used the space as an office for a long time and he continued to work on other projects like Hermez.\nBarcelona\u2019s Giveth house is more than just bricks and mortar. It's a story of community, collaboration, and our commitment to the Optimism Collective's vision. \n",

For users, connecting to dapps was a convoluted and unstable experience. Particularly, switching between networks caused friction that often blocked users from experimenting with L2s like Optimism. \n\nWe built RainbowKit to be the best connect-to-wallet experience for users and the best integration experience for developers. RainbowKit makes connecting your wallet and switching networks a smooth, reliable and enjoyable experience. RainbowKit is fast, easy and highly customizable for developers to install and maintain.\n\nRainbow built RainbowKit to be an open-source public good. Rainbow does not track data or monetize from the SDK. ",

Users are 39% more likely to complete transaction on OP chain in dapps that use RK vs other connectors. Users are 139% more likely to switch networks after completing a transaction in RK dapps. ",

We co-hosted the event with Bartek of L2BEAT, who kindly shared his wealth of knowledge with our audience about Optimism including computational requirements, scaling models, and RPGF as a community engagement and ecosystem growth tool.\n\nThe second piece expanded on the initial conversation by exploring the OP stack and the projects that are using it. We had three different projects that use the OP stack to build: Mantle, Metis and Goshen. Each provided tons of insights about why they chose Optimism, and encouraged listeners to start building on OP.",

The second conversation on Spaces where we expanded on the OP stack saw a 414% increase with over 1,600 downloads with the newsletter seeing a similar read rate as the first.\n\nWhile we set out to produce high-quality content introducing the Optimism ecosystem, we were not surprised to see the content also be well received by the developer community as evidenced by the audience that was drawn to both events. Having L2BEAT share their insights at the first event, and three accomplished developers and projects at the second event certainly helped influence the programming's success and impact.",

On top of this, Dapps can develop services that require a reputation system, such as curated social networks, fair airdrops/ICOs, DeFi, DAO governance etc. Chainlink and The Graph are used for decentralization and verifiability of our solution.\n\nThe alpha version of EtherScore is live on Mumbai testnet and offers more than 80 badges for users of the most popular Dapps and chains. Of these 80 badges, 13 are related to the Optimism ecosystem, cumulating to 120,000 mints (details in the Impact section).",

      "Contribution Description": "We successfully produced two pivotal conferences in Paris and Berlin, attended by 400 and 350 individuals respectively. These events encompassed a diverse group of builders, protocol developers, scholars, and the general populace, raising awareness of public goods funding, within and beyond web3. The events are truly a space to showcase research and development in the public goods funding space. We co-produced the Public Goods Week at Zuzalu Montenegro, creating a nexus for web3 public goods leaders, catalyzing fresh partnerships and collaborations. Additionally, our Berlin residency provided an oasis for public goods builders, granting them unparalleled access to leading protocols in the EVM landscape including Optimism, and the freedom to ideate away from traditional startup pressures.",

      "Impact Description": "Our Berlin residency addressed a critical void, offering public goods builders a collaborative sanctuary to innovate, creating ideal conditions for collaborative production of public goods. This environment incubated numerous new projects (see reference links), and enabled collaborations to emerge. Our residency, Zuzalu PG week, and our conferences in Paris and Berlin confronted the challenge of work duplication. Many innovators building in isolation often duplicate efforts. Gathering in a physical domain, they discovered synergies, triggering newfound collaborations. This not only optimized individual projects but also infused efficiency within the broader web3 ecosystem. With notable relevance to Optimism, Laura (@0xyNaMu) developed an Optimism impact evaluation framework.",

Some of these projects are:\n- Ticking-Optimism: A fork of op-node that adds a system transaction calling a predefined address every block.\n- Concrete: A framework for building application-specific rollups on the OP Stack.\n- Shadow Rollup: An indexer rollup that tracks the gas consumption of every smart contract in another rollup by re-deriving it from L1 with a custom execution engine.",

Our goal: foster secure innovation by advocating sensible regulations. We urge lawmakers to see the broad societal impact of these technologies. We've fought against harmful regulations, like banning crypto wallets, equating NFTs to securities, or labelling protocols as bank accounts. We explained why these are detrimental and bridged regulatory intentions with the Ethereum community. We've collaborated with global organizations to curb impractical crypto laws because regulation can make or break an industry, and we won't let it hinder this ecosystem.",

This is achieved through our auto-compounding wrapper (wBLT), which is transferable. Our native protocol liquidity is wBLT-BMX, demonstrating that wBLT can be paired with any asset and continue to earn wBLT rewards. wBLT can also be collateralized. LPing is inherently complex, to support user education, we intentionally named our liquidity after a sandwich, for the meme and for the concept of multiple ingredients (assets) combined to form one sandwich (token). In our documentation, we dive deep into user education, benefits/risks, and concept modeling as we believe onboarding users from CEX to DEX depends on it!",

Trading volume has surpassed $4.7mm+ with over $8k+ in revenue. wBLT-(OtherAsset) liquidity pools have surpassed $530k+ TVL. Liquidity providers of protocols like Yearn Finance and Ethos Reserve have deployed wBLT-YFI and wBLT-stERN liquidity pools on Velocimeter. Instead of pairing wETH-YFI or USDC-stERN, wBLT allows bluechip capital to be put to work and earn additional revenue for the LP/protocol in addition to pool2 rewards. wBLT as a paired asset composed of multiple bluechips and stablecoins may also reduce single-asset price volatility risk. The features of BMX by Morphex and use-cases of wBLT introduce unique reasons to bridge to BASE.",

Our work has served as a blueprint for other builders in the space, including Rage Trade, a project which previously integrated only GMX on Arbitrum. Our open source Python SDK was cited as one of the tools they used to build their integration on Optimism. \n\nWe've also worked directly with integrators such as Tradao, STFX, and Copin to provide marketing, business development, and technical support to build the Optimism community.",

This fuses the value props of typical lending pools with typical vault strategies into a single, better UX app.\n\nAdditionally, Seamless has soulbound token points (called OG Points) where usage is rewarded with non-transferrable tokens to represent loyalty and \"OG-ness,\" opening the door for even more innovative utility in the ecosystem.",

This interaction allowed participants to create wallets on the Optimism mainnet, make fund transfers, and create multisig wallets on Safe in order to engage with Gitcoin Grants.\n\nIn order to submit a project teams were asked to learn about how to deploy their hackathon project on Optimism.

      "Impact Description": "Notably, in the African context, where Optimism interactions are less common, this experience served as a valuable introduction to the ecosystem. For those accustomed to the Binance chain, the onboarding process was particularly enlightening. It bridged the gap between Binance's P2P transactions and obtaining OETH, showcasing the significantly reduced gas fees on Optimism. This firsthand experience was valuable in promoting Optimism's adoption within the community and highlighting its cost-efficiency.",

It has also been a playground for brainstorming syntax features that may or may not make it into Vyper eventually. Because of its lispy nature, these syntax features can be implemented easily as compile-time Dasy macros. If they're good, more robust support can make it into either Dasy or potentially even Vyper itself.",

The contracts support pricing that requires complex routes with many hops, support non-standard ERC20 implementations and non-standard AMM curves, and are even optimized to allow for pricing 100+ tokens in a single function call so that it can best take advantage of the public Optimism RPC without using unnecessary computation and getting throttled. The Optimism Prices contracts have been iterated upon for many months with direct feedback from some of the largest projects in the Optimism ecosystem, like Velodrome and Aerodrome, which use Optimism Prices in production.",

Optimism ecosystem devs no longer need to shell out cash for centralized pricing APIs with spotty uptime, instead they can merely execute a single RPC call using Optimism Prices. Optimism Prices' sole focus and dedication to the Optimism ecosystem allows us to maintain well-engineered integrations for the popular destinations for tokens on Optimism and Base, which lets us guarantee 100% coverage for pricing any asset. As a result, Optimism Prices is the sole price feed relied on by Velodrome and Aerodrome, the #2 and #1 projects by TVL on OP Mainnet and Base respectively.",

CoSoul's launch exceeded our expectation. 26,000 contributors to web3 have minted the SBTs since June. This has resulted in 46,000+ transactions, as CoSouls are synched each month with data from Coordinape, adding more clarity to the reputation map on OP.

With 152 of 195 countries being developing, reducing blockchain entry barriers is vital for global adoption. Inverter's modular infrastructure significantly cuts down smart contract setup time and running costs for new applications.\n\nWe onboarded projects that are building on Optimism by making it possible to deploy web3 products in an agile way. With Inverter workflows, implementing smart contracts is only configuration process, rather than engineering challenge: \n- No more need to individually finance audits and security protocols \n- No more need for dedicated smart contract team or timely development cycles to implement new features or modify the old ones.",

So people start to ask me how can I leverage RPGF, what can we build for Optimism, and I showed the way with solid examples. \n\nBefore the RPGF#2 I was not interesting with data analyzes and I was running Optimism_TR twitter account with 2 other friends, then we took a share from RPGF #2 and split the word, mention about it. This created an excitement around Turkish community some followers of the account reach out us for contributing now there are 11 people who creates contents about Optimism. And during the term only %10 of the contents created by old crew. \n",

The vast majority of my content is freely available to allow for a space for those working in the crypto space to be able to understand the political implications of their work and to be able to apply political theory to crypto.

Which allowed for an RPG type game to thrive with over 300+ NFTs to find as loot.\n\nBehind Lorak is LandTorn is a gaming hub built on Optimisim Base, acting as a publisher and distributor of games with a focus on on-chain innovation.

By default, wallets only supported mainnet or required users to manually add an RPC to interact with L2s. Wallet balances were siloed by network, causing friction when using multiple chains and leading many users to perceive their OP assets as secondary to their assets on mainnet.\n\nSince 2021, Rainbow Wallet has prioritized its support for L2 networks and introduced new design patterns that dramatically improved their usability. Rainbow was first to offer native L2 support (without having to manually add RPCs), implement frictionless in-app swapping and bridging between networks, and establish a multinetwork UI that consolidates mainnet and L2 assets - now the UX standard for many wallets.",

In each case, cryo is the fastest tool for bulk data extraction thanks to use of rust and modern data engineering best practices\n\n- cryo makes it feasible for individuals to run an entire crypto analysis pipeline on their laptop instead of depending on 3rd party services\n\n- cryo is 100% free and open source under an unrestricted Apache/MIT license. You can do pretty much anything you want with it",

However, cryo makes it easy for anyone to run a complete open-source crypto analysis pipeline on their own laptop. This presents a huge cost savings and shifts the process back toward the crypto principles of decentralization and open-source.\n\nEven though cryo is still in beta, many teams have integrated it into their backend infra. This includes data platforms (CoinMetrics), security firms (shield3), news outlets (TheBlock), MEV teams (private), and on-chain protocols (Zora).\n\ncryo also powers the Paradigm Data Portal, which is the only place to download complete open-source historical crypto datasets without sign-up.",
