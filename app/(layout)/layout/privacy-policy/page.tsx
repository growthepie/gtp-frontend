        Data protection is of a particularly high priority for orbal GmbH. The
        use of the Internet pages of orbal GmbH is possible without any
        indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use
        special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data
        could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary
        and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain
        consent from the data subject.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
        address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
        with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
        with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to
        orbal GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise
        would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and
        purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore,
        data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection
        declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.

      <p className="mb-4">
        As the controller, orbal GmbH has implemented numerous technical and
        organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of
        personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based
        data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
        protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is
        free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
        telephone.

            so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the
            cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet
            pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
            in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
            and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data
            subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A

            The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter
            access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken

            Collection of general data and information

          <p className="mb-4">
            The website of orbal GmbH collects a series of general data and
            information when a data subject or automated system calls up the
            website. This general data and information are stored in the server
            log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used,
            (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the
            website from which an accessing system reaches our website
            (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time
            of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP
            address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system,
            and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in
            the event of attacks on our information technology systems. When
            using these general data and information, orbal GmbH does not draw
            any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is
            needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2)
            optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement,
            (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology
            systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement
            authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution
            in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, orbal GmbH analyzes
            anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the
            aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our
            enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the
            personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files
            are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data
            subject.

          <p className="mb-4">
            On the website of orbal GmbH, users are given the opportunity to
            subscribe to our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask used for
            this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well
            as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller. orbal GmbH
            informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a
            newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may
            only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a
            valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the
            newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the
            e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for
            newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in
            procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the
            owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to
            receive the newsletter. During the registration for the newsletter,
            we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the
            Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the
            time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the
            registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to
            understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data
            subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the
            legal protection of the controller. The personal data collected as
            part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send
            our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be
            informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation
            of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this
            could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter
            offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There
            will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter
            service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be
            terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the
            storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for
            shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose
            of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each
            newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter
            at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to
            communicate this to the controller in a different way.

          <p className="mb-4">
            The newsletter of orbal GmbH contains so-called tracking pixels. A
            tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails,
            which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and
            analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or
            failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded
            tracking pixel, orbal GmbH may see if and when an e-mail was opened
            by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by
            data subjects.Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels
            contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the
            controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as
            well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to
            the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be
            passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled
            to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by
            means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these
            personal data will be deleted by the controller. orbal GmbH
            automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the
            newsletter as a revocation.

          <strong className="mb-2">Rights of the data subject</strong>
          <p className="mb-4">
            a) Right of confirmation Each data subject shall have the right
            granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the
            confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or
            her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself
            of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact
            any employee of the controller. b) Right of access Each data subject
            shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain
            from the controller free information about his or her personal data
            stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the
            European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to
            the following information:the purposes of the processing; the
            categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories
            of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be
            disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or
            international organisations; where possible, the envisaged period
            for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the
            criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right
            to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal
            data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the
            data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the
            right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the
            personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available
            information as to their source; the existence of automated
            decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1)
            and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful
            information about the logic involved, as well as the significance
            and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
            Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain
            information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third
            country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case,
            the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the
            appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.If a data subject
            wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at
            any time, contact any employee of the controller. c) Right of
            rectification Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
            European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue
            delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him
            or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data
            subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data
            completed, including by means of providing a supplementary
            statement.If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to
            rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of
            the controller. d) Right to erasure (right to be forgotten) Each
            data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator
            to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data
            concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall
            have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where
            one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is
            not necessary:The personal data are no longer necessary in relation
            to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
            processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the
            processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the
            GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is
            no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects
            to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there
            are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data
            subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the
            GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal
            data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union
            or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal
            data have been collected in relation to the offer of information
            society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.If one of
            the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to
            request the erasure of personal data stored by orbal GmbH, he or she
            may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An
            employee of orbal GmbH shall promptly ensure that the erasure
            request is complied with immediately.Where the controller has made
            personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to
            erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available
            technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable
            steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers
            processing the personal data that the data subject has requested
            erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication
            of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An
            employee of orbal GmbH will arrange the necessary measures in
            individual cases. e) Right of restriction of processing Each data
            subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to
            obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of
            the following applies:The accuracy of the personal data is contested
            by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify
            the accuracy of the personal data. The processing is unlawful and
            the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and
            requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The
            controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the
            processing, but they are required by the data subject for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The data subject
            has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR
            pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the
            controller override those of the data subject.If one of the
            aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to
            request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by
            orbal GmbH, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the
            controller. The employee of orbal GmbH will arrange the restriction
            of the processing. f) Right to data portability Each data subject
            shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive
            the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a
            controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
            format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to
            another controller without hindrance from the controller to which
            the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is
            based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR
            or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant
            to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is
            carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not
            necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
            controller.Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data
            portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject
            shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from
            one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing
            so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.In
            order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may
            at any time contact any employee of orbal GmbH. f) Right to object
            Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
            legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular
            situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning
            him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of
            the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
            orbal GmbH shall no longer process the personal data in the event of
            the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
            grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and
            freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or
            defence of legal claims.If orbal GmbH processes personal data for
            direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to
            object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or
            her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that
            it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects
            to orbal GmbH to the processing for direct marketing purposes,
            orbalGmbH will no longer process the personal data for these
            purposes.In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds
            relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing
            of personal data concerning him or her by orbal GmbH for scientific
            or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes
            pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is
            necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of
            public interest.In order to exercise the right to object, the data
            subject may contact any employee of orbal GmbH. In addition, the
            data subject is free in the context of the use of information
            society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use
            his or her right to object by automated means using technical
            specifications. h) Automated individual decision-making, including
            profiling Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
            European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on
            automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal
            effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects
            him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for
            entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data
            subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or
            Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also
            lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights
            and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the
            data subject’s explicit consent.If the decision (1) is necessary for
            entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data
            subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data
            subject’s explicit consent, orbal GmbH shall implement suitable
            measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and
            legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human
            intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her
            point of view and contest the decision.If the data subject wishes to
            exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making,
            he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of orbal GmbH. i)
            Right to withdraw data protection consent Each data subject shall
            have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or
            her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
            If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the
            consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of orbal
            GmbH.

            Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google
            Analytics (with anonymisation function)
          </strong>
          <p className="mb-4">
            On this website, the controller has integrated the component of
            Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is
            a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering,
            and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A
            web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website
            from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which
            sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a
            sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the
            optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit
            analysis of Internet advertising.The operator of the Google
            Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
            Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.For the web analytics through
            Google Analytics the controller uses the application “_gat.
            _anonymizeIp”. By means of this application the IP address of the
            Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and
            anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the
            European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the
            European Economic Area.The purpose of the Google Analytics component
            is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected
            data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website
            and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our
            websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our
            Internet site for us.Google Analytics places a cookie on the
            information technology system of the data subject. The definition of
            cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google
            is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to
            one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated
            by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was
            integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology
            system of the data subject will automatically submit data through
            the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising
            and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of
            this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of
            personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject,
            which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of
            visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission
            settlements.The cookie is used to store personal information, such
            as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and
            the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With
            each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the
            IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be
            transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These
            personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
            Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical
            procedure to third parties.The data subject may, as stated above,
            prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by
            means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus
            permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the
            Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from
            setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data
            subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may
            be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software
            programs.In addition, the data subject has the possibility of
            objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google
            Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as
            the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any
            such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser
            add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and
            install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a
            JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of
            Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The
            installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by
            Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is
            later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject
            must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If
            the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other
            person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is
            disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or
            reactivation of the browser add-ons.Further information and the
            applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved
            under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under

            Legal basis for the processing Art. 6(1) lit. a
          </strong>
          <p className="mb-4">
            GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which
            we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the
            processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a
            contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for
            example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of
            goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on
            Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing
            operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual
            measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our
            products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation
            by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the
            fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)
            lit. c GDPR.In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be
            necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of
            another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a
            visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health
            insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on
            to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing
            would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.Finally, processing
            operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal
            basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any
            of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for
            the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or
            by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the
            interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
            which require protection of personal data. Such processing
            operations are particularly permissible because they have been
            specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered
            that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
            client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

            law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual
            provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).Sometimes
            it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject
            provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed
            by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with
            personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The
            non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that
            the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.Before
            personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must
            contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject
            whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or
            contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether
            there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the
            consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
