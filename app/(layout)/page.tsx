            question="What's the difference between Ethereum Mainnet and the Ethereum ecosystem?"
            answer={
              <>
                Ethereum Mainnet, also called Ethereum L1, is the Ethereum blockchain
                that launched in 2015. The Ethereum ecosystem, however, includes many
                blockchains that are built on top of Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 2s). These
                blockchains settle to Ethereum Mainnet and therefore can benefit from
                some of its security guarantees. Not all of these chains necessarily run
                the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) - Layer 2s can also use other VMs 
                (i.e. CairoVM, SVM, FuelVM, etc.). The VM doesn't define the Ethereum 
                ecosystem - settling to Ethereum Mainnet defines it.

            answer={
              <>
                The &quot;multiple&quot; category denotes addresses that were
                active on multiple networks (Ethereum Mainnet OR Layer 2) within a given week.
                This implies that if an address was active on different networks,
                such as Arbitrum and OP Mainnet, in the same week, it would
                be included in the &quot;multiple&quot; category. For a more detailed
                breakdown of active addresses on each individual chain, please

                Thank you for attesting your contracts via <Link

                Your attestations are securely stored in the OLI Label Pool.
                We, as growthepie, consume labels from the OLI Label Pool and
                we apply our own verification step before we add them to our platform.
                Usually, this step takes 1 to 3 days and you should see your application
                being listed very soon. In case you have issues, please reach out via
                Discord.

            answer={
              <>
                The goal is to cover as many Layer 2s as possible. We will add
                more Layer 2s over time. For our type of analysis, we need
                access to the raw data of each L2. This makes adding new L2s
                time and resource-consuming. Our goal is to cover at least 80%
                of all Ethereum ecosystem usage.

                All dates on our website use UTC time. This makes it easier for
